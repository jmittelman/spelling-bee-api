## Project 2 Proposal

I intend to build my app for Project 2 using data about The Scripps National Spelling Bee.

A statistician scraped the results from the competition's website and made it user-friendly:

[octonion github: (spelling bees)](https://github.com/octonion/spelling).

With the information, I will build 3 models:

- Bees (year, champion)
- Champions (name, sponsor, winning word (word, definition) )
- Sponsors (name, city, state)

I find it interesting that for certain years there have been multiple champions and that certain sponsors have been associated with multiple champions.
